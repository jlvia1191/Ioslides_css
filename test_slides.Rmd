## Using the footer div

Normal rmarkdown footnotes don't seem to render in ioslides. I've added a new class called "footer". If you wish to add a footer you can do it with:

```
<div class = "footer">
My text
</div>
```

If you want to refer to it in main text with superscripts then you'll have to use html e.g. 

```
if art is interchangeable with language; if that is not the case,  
sexuality<sup>1</sup> may be used
```



## Slide with Text

If one examines pretextual desublimation, one is faced with a choice: either
reject Baudrillardist simulation or conclude that the State is capable of
significance, but only if art is interchangeable with language; if that is not the case, sexuality<sup>1</sup> may be used to oppress the proletariat. The subject is contextualised into a pretextual paradigm of narrative that includes art as a
reality. Therefore, the premise of Baudrillardist simulation<sup>2</sup> holds that the
goal of the artist is deconstruction, given that the pretextual paradigm of
narrative is valid.

## Plot.ly interactive plot 1

```{r echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}

# Install packages 
library(ggplot2) 
library(plotly)

# Load data
crays <- read.csv("Gut analysis records v4 consolidated FoO.csv")

# Draw graph
### <b>
p <- ggplot(crays, aes(x = Size.mm, y = Weight.g, colour = Sex)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  xlab("Length (mm)") + ylab("Weight (g)")
### </b>

ggplotly(p)
```

## Plot.ly interactive plot 2 {.flexbox .vcenter}

```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

crays <- read.csv("Gut analysis records v4 consolidated FoO.csv")
### <b>
p <- ggplot(crays, aes(x = Size.mm, y = Weight.g, colour = Sex)) +
  geom_point() + theme_bw() + scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  xlab("Length (mm)") + ylab("Weight (g)")
### </b>

ggplotly(p)

## Maths test

$$ x^{2} $$


$$ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} $$


<div class = "notes">
- Colour of maths is rendered as the same as normal text
- Not sure how to adjust size, maybe from within LaTeX code?
</div>

## Table test

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(crays[1:4, 1:5])

df1
```
